You will be given a list of text sections, each labeled with a number. Each section summarizes part of a story, but these parts belong to larger narrative units.

Your task is to analyze the structure and group the sections into these higher-level narrative units. The number of groups should be around 0.2x - 0.6x as much as the number of text sections, but not strictly.

Identify and list the section numbers that mark the beginning of each higher-level narrative unit. Keep in mind that the text is being clamped, so the first section with a label greater than 1 may not necessarily be a starting point.

If there are multiple parallel sidequest. Try to group them. If you found it is hardly reduce the number of groups, try to agressively group them into bigger bundles.

Try to identify important narrative closures and use them as narrative boundary.
